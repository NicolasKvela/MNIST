# MNIST
MNIST code
ChatGPT said:
In mid-July 2025, I built an AI to recognize handwritten numbers using the MNIST dataset. I used Python and TensorFlow to train a model that learned from images of digits 0â€“9. I reshaped and scaled the data so the AI could understand it, and after training, it could guess new digits correctly.

I had some setup issues, like installing packages or running code, but ChatGPT helped fix them and explained things clearly.

This project helped me learn how to use virtual environments, install and manage Python libraries, work with image data, understand how neural networks learn, and train a model step by step.
